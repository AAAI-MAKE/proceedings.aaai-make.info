## AAAI Preprint Policy

DO NOT cite, link to, redistribute, or republish AAAI-endorsed preprints. These are not the final versions of the papers. The final versions will be published later and should be the version used for citations and links. The preprints have been made available for symposia attendees only.

## Preprint Servers

Authors ARE allowed to publish preprints without the AAAI copyright notice (i.e., not the AAAI-endorsed version) to preprint servers such as arXiv. However, authors are NOT allowed to publish the AAAI-endorsed preprints (with the AAAI copyright notice) to preprint servers.

## Returned Rights

Once the final version is published, authors can republish the final version of the paper for noncommercial use in their own websites and/or their university's archives (see Returned Rights 3 and 4 from the copyright form). Additionally, authors are specifically granted back the right to use their own papers for noncommercial uses, such as inclusion in their dissertations, provided there is proper attribution.
